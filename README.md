# Working group updates

## 5 April, 2023

**Notes:**
- MIT group showed preliminary results of cylinder motion.
- James(MIT) discussed appropriate initial conditions for incompressible cylinder case.
  
**Action items:**
- Per generating + providing cylinder meshes in Gmsh format.
- Nathan working towards adding 2022 data and setting up standardized data-input/processing.
- James adding write-up substantiating incompressible initial conditions.
